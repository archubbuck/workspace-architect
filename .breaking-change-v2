# Breaking Change - v2.0.0

This release introduces a breaking change to the CLI command pattern.

## What Changed

The CLI command format has been updated from:
```
npx workspace-architect download <type>:<name>
```

To:
```
npx workspace-architect download <type> <name>
```

## Backward Compatibility

The old format is still supported with a deprecation warning to help users migrate smoothly.

## Migration Guide

Users should update their scripts and commands to use the new space-separated format instead of the colon-separated format.

Old format (deprecated):
- `npx workspace-architect download agents:azure-architect`
- `npx wsa download instructions:reactjs`

New format:
- `npx workspace-architect download agents azure-architect`
- `npx wsa download instructions reactjs`
